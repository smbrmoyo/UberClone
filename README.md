# UberClone

First FullStack project I actually worked on. 

This a clone of the famous Uber App. I implemented the all the UI components, the navigation (RN V5) and a GraphQl backend.

The app is pretty simple (just like the real one) but quite complete in terms of Front -and- Backend.

I mainly used react-native-maps, react-native-navigation, react-native-reanimated and react-native-places-autocomplete.

The GraphQL API allows us to fetch the drivers' location in real time and display all the available taxis on the animated Map.
